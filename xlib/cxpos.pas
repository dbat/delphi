//  unit cxpos, a class extension (+sample implementations) of
//  expos (extended pos), the extremely high performance unit
//  of SubString/Pattern Search & Replace,
//  using the new, proposed Sofyan-Hafizh BoundCheck algorithm,
//  plus assembler (x86) tricks in an advanced delphi programming
//
//  target compiler: Delphi5
//  target CPU: intel 486+ compatible
//              (PentiumTick works only in Pentium+)
//
//  hyperbolic hype:
//  this is the fastest implementation of pattern search algorithm,
//  the replace function is *at-least* 25 times faster than the
//  standard delphi's StringReplace on a very light task, and raised
//  exponentially according to the weight (1000-3000++ times faster
//  on heavy duties ones). note: the number is NOT in percent.
//
//  important notes:
//    the pattern mentioned here is NOT a regular pattern or mask
//    such as "ab*" or "p?q", instead is a sequence of arbitrary
//    characters (bytes) ie. a string as it is, WITHOUT no more
//    interpretation (other than case sensitivity).

//  based on expos Version: 1.0.2.7 (discontinued) by the same authors,

  benchmark:
    the thanks goes to Peter Morrise's fastStrings unit (ver-3.2)
    and Martin Waldenburg's mwTSearch class (ver-2.0), also Angus
    Johnson's Search component (ver-2.2), whose ideas (and misses)
    has been examined for the advantages to this unit.

    the TmTSearch by Martin Waldenburg appears to be the fastest
    compared to the others, with an exception as described below.

    the Search component by Angus Johnson is the slowest, however
    we admit that it is the best that we could get in pure pascal.

    the fastrings unit by Peter Morris performance took place
    between the two's above (only a bit slower than the 1st),
    and considered to be the most matured one with many folks
    included within the development.

    this unit is quite lot faster than the other's implementations.
    for a common search, (ie. case-sensitive, length > 1, arbitrary
    characters with some are duplicated), she cuts at least 30~40%
    of the processing time. yet if that is not enough, then by the
    insensitive search, charpos and the *ultimate* case & repeated-
    chars detection integrated in this unit, she could be much far
    beyond. (the last one in effect squashes at *minimum* 3X faster!).

    (that is just a benchmark. of course, it's not fair to
    comparing their implementations with single algorithm
    alone with this acrobatic-mixed algorithm).

  algorithm:
    this unit make use of an algorithm similar to boyer-moore's,
    maximize the efficiency based on understanding of the length-
    integrity-check. the core algorithm is basically similar to
    the algorithm applied by Martin Waldenburg. while martin's
    implementation was faster compared with the other two, she had
    still (at least one obvious) gotcha that she failed to catch
    for a repeated-chars, such as 'EEEE' on (N div 2) * N position,
    where N is the length of pattern to find. when she forced to
    give the correct result (the jump altered, as suggested by
    Martin himself), the performance will degrades significantly
    down to that of Boyer-Moore's implementation by faststrings
    unit of Peter Morrise. note however, it means that the
    altered one is not based on her algorithm anymore.

    nevertheless, even the slowest, still is considered better
    than a *fast* one but with defect.

    actually the algorithm that he had used was (perhaps) broken
    (unfortunaltely we have no access to the source doc itself,
    but according to our examination) it had a subtle flaw
    to pick an arbitrarily anchor index (half-pattern length,
    as she called it, we named it boundcheck).
    Generally her matching algorithm works ONLY for non-repeated
    chars, ie. no duplicate characters found in the SubStr/pattern
    to be matched.

    (for more details please read on our analysis paper about this
    indexed-character-based matching algorithm).

}
{
// ====================================================================
// USAGE:
// ====================================================================

  1. add in unit clause:
       uses cxpos;

  2. declare variable of txSearch:
       var
         tx: txSearch;

  3. create an instance of txSearch:
       tx := txSearch.Create;

     note that there are character based search functions
     which already available & do not need an object creation.
     (CharPos & CharCount)

  4. initialize pattern and case option, ie. tells the program
     what substring to be searched for, and whether capitalization
     is important or not. this procedure could be previously done
     at creation stage or delayed later until actual search/replace
     soon to be proceed.

     we called the initialization at creation as noted above as an
     IMPLICIT initialization and the later as EXPLICIT intialization.

     this explicit initialization is quite tight though, the state
     (pattern and case-option) would not be changed if it could be
     detected that the pattern to be matched would never be found
     anyway.

     creation and initialization at once:
       tx := txSearch.Create('Some substrings to be searched for');
       tx := txSearch.Create('another pattern', TRUE); // default = FALSE

     note that once initialized, all subsequent search will be
     using the new/current initialization state

  5. do the actual search:

       i:= tx.Pos(BigString); // default = start from 1
       i:= tx.Pos(BigString, 1969); // start from position 1969

     as mentioned above, we may delay initialization until
     actual search, this also required if we change/start a new
     pattern to be searched for (or change its case option):

       i := tx.pos(BigString, 'pattern', TRUE, 1969)
       i := tx.pos(BigString, 'pattern2') // default = start from 1

  6. miscellaneous sample implementation,
       function StrCount, returns count of the pattern
       function StrCountInfile, returns count of the pattern within a file
       function StrReplace, returns the string of Search/Replace
       procedure ReplaceStr, simply a StrReplace function wrapper
       FindFirst/Next/Close, search within a file
       FileReplace, replace within a file

  7. function prototypes
     a.for searching a pattern
         function(SubStr, S, StartPos, IgnoreCase)

     b.for searching pattern within a file
         FindInfile(SubStr, FileName, StartPos, IgnoreCase, KeepPriorState)

     c.for search and replace:
         function(S, SubStr, Replacement, StartPos, IgnoreCase, ReplaceAll)

     d.for search and replace within a file
       (actually with the same order and types as above):
         function(FileName, SubStr, Replacement, StartPos, IgnoreCase, ReplaceAll)

       required arguments are S (or FileName) and SubStr, the remaining
       arguments ar optional with default values:
         StartPos = 1
         IgnoreCase = FALSE
         CloseFind = FALSE (close file after file-search proceed)
         ReplaceAll = TRUE

       when initialization has been done, either by calling function
       with complete arguments as above or by explicitly call Init then
       subsequent calls should be without: SubStr & IgnoreCase option

       a'.for searching a pattern:
            function(S, StartPos)

       b'.for searching pattern within a file
           FindFirst(FileName, StartPos)
           FindFrom(StartPos, CloseFind)
           FindNext(CloseFind)
           FindClose

       c'.for search and replace:
           function(S, Replacement, StartPos, ReplaceAll)

       d'.for search and replace within a file
           function(FileName, Replacement, StartPos, ReplaceAll)

       for searching within a file, there is special group of functions
       (for our convenience), namely findFirst, findNext and findClose.
       the findFirst function works as b'. above:

         CloseFind option means to reset the find-state
         (filename, handles, size, position, etc.) of the
         opened file. the state will not be changed, if the
         program could detect earlier that the pattern to be
         matched would not ever been found anyway.

         the same rules also applied for replace in file, for
         example, if we tried to proceed a 0-size file, or the
         file size < pattern-length, or replace by the same pattern
         (with case sensitive on), the program will not dumbly
         continued our request. since file processing is always
         expensive, the program will avoid them as she could.

       actually the findfirst is not limited only to the first
       occurence of pattern, since the StartPos could be given
       in anywhere, whereas the findNext is always get the next
       occurence of pattern (if any) of the previous findFirst
       result.

       those group of functions should have been properly
       initialized before they are used.

       use FindInfile instead to initialize the pattern &
       case-option.

       if KeepPriorState options set to TRUE then the previous
       find-state of the findfirst family (if any) will be
       preserved (this one-shot feature is useful if you have
       to intterupt the ongoing process of findfirst function
       family without disturbing them), otherwise (if it set
       to FALSE) then the previous find-state will be closed
       and changed according to the find-state of successful
       FindInfile (if FindInfile  fails, the previous
       find-state wouldn't be changed).

  -  there are two forms of search: against a String or pointer.
     use the pointer form to search in memory, file buffer, pchar etc.

  -  File-based replace, effective for a very large file, and the most
     important is- when the filesize is expected not to be changed,
     ie. when the length of pattern to be searched is equal with its
     replacement, then it should be much faster than utilizing temporary
     string & filestream.

     using direct file access, beside of speed gain, also means we do
     not have to allocate temporary buffer (thus wasting memory) by
     the same amount of file size, this especially much worth when the
     file is large enough.

  -  stop.

//  =======

{
   version: 2.0.3.2
   ================
   1. Singular pattern detection bug fixed
   2. Case-sensitive detection bug fixed
   3. Add special treatment for a single chars-pair

   Notes:
   We found that BoundCheck supposed to be Sub-Optimal (rather than Super-
   Optimal) for small string. It best for special case (such as substr to
   be found is long enough and its composed by varies enough characters),
   for it wasted too much clocks for calculating Index-Values (at least with
   additional 5-6 instructions per cycle), suppressing its efficiency.
   The speed superiority we have got here is NOT a credit of BoundCheck
   but rather of assembler tweaking plus various mixed detection algorithm.
   Curently, the BoundCheck at first ordinal position is the (only) state
   that additional speed we might get will be fair enough compared to the
   cost of calculating Index-Values.

   version: 2.0.3.1
   ================
   here are only quick-fix not to mention for a final (efficient) release
   important note:
   1. bug-fix for version 2.0.3.0 (inbound-scanning previously done from
      low to high ordinal position (for ease), that was simply violates
      the very principle rule of range-bound, duh...)
   2. singular pattern recognizer false detection. since we have not yet
      figured out why, we suspend this feature, open for comment/reports
   3. the same initialization (substr & case) resulting in different state,
      we can not yet even to reproduce this bug, open for comment/reports
   As our motto:
      The slowest one still is better than even the fastest with some bug

   version: 2.0.3.0
   ================
   Documenting revision changes starting from version 2.0.3.0?
   Better late than never :)

   actually, since the old code rarely deleted (they only commented)
   we could track the change after that.

   most important changes were:
     - separation of char-based primitive routines to chpos unit
         charpos now also supports backpos direction search
     - separation of file-handling operation to cxfvmap unit
         (we intended to pick a cryptic name to avoid usage
         of that very specific unit outside cxpos)
     - SpeedTest demo (benchmark)
     - Ressurection of expos (the original, direct ancestor of cxpos)

 Implementation Of BoundCheck Algorithm

 Initialization of Index-Table

 In this implementation we use the index-Value also as the shift distance (the
 shift taken when non-matched ocurred). The Index-Values will be built in
 reversed order according to their ordinal position in the pattern (counted down
 from the last-character), so the specified HIGHEST actually is the last
 character in pattern, with Index-Value = 0, and the specified LOWEST (unknown
 at first, computed as we build the Index-Table), is the least (negative) Index-
 Value. We will further call the position of the LOWEST as the BoundCheck.

 Since the last character's Index-Value should always be 0, we will initialized
 it properly with Index-Value/shift distance by the OUTRANGE (length of pattern),
 only if it has no TWINS brother, otherwise their TWINS Index-Value will take
 precedence.

 Note that for counting the shift distance, we will get the absolute (positive)
 value of the Index-value, and for convenience, in fact we also store the Index-
 Value in the Index-Table with their absolute (positive) form.

 Example: SubStrings
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|------------
  |-9 |-8 |-7 |-6 |-5 |-4 |-3 |-2 |-1 | 0 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| Char-Case
  | S | u | b | S | t | r | i | n | g | s |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|------------
  |-6 |-8 |-7 |-6 |-5 |-4 |-3 |-2 |-1 |-10| Sensitive
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|------------
  |-6 |-8 |-7 |-6 |-5 |-4 |-3 |-2 |-1 |-6 | Insensitive
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|------------
      LOWEST                         HIGHEST
       (B)

 Example: NumberOfEmployee
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|------------
  |-15|-14|-13|-12|-11|-10|-9 |-8 |-7 |-6 |-5 |-4 |-3 |-2 |-1 | 0 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| Char-Case
  | N | u | m | b | e | r | O | f | E | m | p | l | o | y | e | e |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|------------
  |-15|-14|-6 |-12|-1 |-10|-9 |-8 |-7 |-6 |-5 |-4 |-3 |-2 |-1 |-1 | Sensitive
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|------------
  |-15|-14|-6 |-12|-1 |-10|-3 |-8 |-1 |-6 |-5 |-4 |-3 |-2 |-1 |-1 | Insensitive
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|------------
  LOWEST                                                     HIGHEST
   (B)

 B = BoundCheck position/value

 Right-to-Left Scanning

 In this implementation we do the Right-to-Left scanning, that is the scanning
 will be initialized from Last to First character of the chunk, this will bring
 some consideration of basic rules which will behave differently if we did it
 contrawise.
 
 As noted in the specification, we could reject the whole chunk when the mismatch
 found within then RANGE-BOUND, note that they work only if there are not any
 firstly characters had ever been appeared yet, --one special condition we have
 sure that met is when the BoundCheck is equal with the first ordinal position of
 the pattern, ie. the LOWEST is also the first char. Otherwise, When BoundCheck
 is not at the first ordinal position of the pattern, then the firstly characters
 to be considered with are any characters (thus also Index-Values) between the
 first ordinal position (included) and the BoundCheck position. We should then
 get the highest Index Value among them to be checked against fetched character
 to determine whether the whole chunk might be rejected (on comparison fail) or
 rather skipped by distance indicated by mismatched character.

  Happy new year,

  I tried D7 with enthusiasm, after reading what's new for a brief then
  i install them in a little hurry +pick arbitrary sample project from my store,
  and guess what?... my code (with my favorite lucida console, 8-pt) looks
  pretty ugly, the characters are separated too far away, i dont believe it,
  it drives me mad, because (after many tries, it seems to me that) no way
  i could change it (the way it displayed in the old Delphi).

  well, since i'm, deeply in my heart is an artist, not a programmer or such,
  (i wrote, prepared, treated, and loved to see my code as a poem) i don't
  like that D7's ugly font-rendering style, i thrown away that new delphi,
  crushed the cd, and back to my old-pleasant-code-editor-looking D5.

  yes, maybe it just a matter of taste, but wasn't for that we're actually living for?
  dont buy D7, believe me...

}

{
  the D7 Help is less helpful than D5's, whenever I clicked F1 or Ctrl-F1,
  in D5 almost everytime I just got what I'd expected, whereas D7 gives me
  (too) many junks which I'd rather goto MSDN (or even Google or Wiki) for
  that kind of information.
}
{
  ups- sorry for irritating commentary above. pardon, pardon.. :)P
  I finally got a work around for that annoying problem. I've got to squeeze
  my favorite Lucida Console Advance-Width from 1200+ pix to 1080 pix (yes- we
  are *creating* new font here. name it Lucida Squized, then.

  No MMX, SSE & 3DNow! in Delphi5, not even RDTSC.
  Now it's time to say goodbye to her :(. (grief..)
